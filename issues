1. handle redirects, eg "slanic moldova"

9. Detect OVER_QUERY_LIMIT to analytics
 - add shadow in location summary screen: to green buttons (perhaps), and to the block that surrounds the fotos and title.
 - from nav drawer select  "favorites" -> go back -> select once again favorites: you can't open because currentPosition = position in NavDrawer.
 - Actionbar color and buttons maybe like here: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.life360.android.safetymapd
